# Crop_Price_Prediction_2024

Farmers play a very important role in the agriculture sector. When the prices fall after the 
harvesting of the crops, farmers face massive amounts of losses because this countryâ€™s GDP is 
affected by the price fluctuations of agricultural products. Crop price evaluation and estimation are 
done to take an intelligent decision before farming a specific type of seasonal crops. Predicting the 
price of crop will help in making better decisions which results in minimizing the losses and 
managing the risk of price fluctuations. 
Crop price prediction relies on analyzing historical data, including rainfall patterns and Wholesale 
Price Index (WPI) data. By leveraging various data mining techniques, such as decision tree 
regression, predictive models can be developed to estimate crop prices. Decision tree regression is a 
supervised machine learning algorithm utilized in this system to predict crop prices based on factors 
like area harvested, area planted, rainfall, and crop yield. 
The proposed system employs decision tree regression to analyze historical data and forecast crop 
prices for the upcoming twelve months. This predictive capability provides farmers with valuable 
insights into the future prices of their crops, enabling them to manage risks and minimize potential 
losses. By utilizing advanced analytics, farmers can make more informed decisions, enhancing their 
resilience to market fluctuations and fostering sustainable agricultural practices
